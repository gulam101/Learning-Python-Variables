# Python-Variables


### Description: 

This project just focus on learning Python Variables. 

In Python defining variables are going to be important as this stores our information. Example, the variable 'y' isn't going to be the same as 'Y'. One is lowercase while the other is uppercase. These are both differnet variables and they are going to be storing different data.

When dealing with an big application the chances are their is going to be lots of variables with different functions. Each functions are going to be important so having them with apporopite name is going to make it easier when accessing variables.
