# Python-Variables


### Description: 

This project just focus on learning Python Variables. 

In Python defining variables are going to be important as this stores our information. Example, the variable 'y' isn't going to be the same as 'Y'. One is lowercase while the other is uppercase. These are both differnet variables and they are going to be storing different data.

When dealing with an big application the chances are their is going to be lots of variables with different functions. Each functions are going to be important so having them with apporopite name is going to make it easier when accessing variables.

## Python Data Variables

In Python, variables have int, float and complex. They all store numbers and Python can call them as long as you put in the correct name.

You can write text in Python which allows you store things like names and other data that you want to keep. Text is called string in Python.
